Hello, my name is Samiyah Siddiqui. I am a soon-to-be graduate of East Brunswick High School. I'll be going to Rutgers University-
New Brunswick in the fall to major in Civil and Environmental Engineering. 

Outside of engineering, I have a passion for social justiceand politics, and oftentimes during this pandemic I've been finding myself reading the news more and more, as well as donating. 
During this quarantine, I've also been journaling and watching educational documentaries on Netflix such as "13th" and "Who Killed 
Malcolm X?"
